     Thank you Nicola. Thank you for giving the time.
   laughter
   So umm basically, I think that you have read the information sheet - and so there is a few of us that um are doing interviews of various health professionals, either people we know or sometimes people that we don’t know – to try and get an idea about what peoples experiences were with the teleconference type thing, phone, zoom etc etc – so it is is literally looking at the themes that come up – that people think happened to them – so you won’t be identifiable as you know – that is not part of the thing
   Is there any questions that you’ve got about that?
So I am supposed to put your discipline – well I know that and then years in practice
I think.......
Ok brilliant – ah so thats all that - and in that role
It seems longer ago......to me it seems like you have always been in that role – to be honest
Yes – particularly over the covid time – would there be.........
umm
No
Ummm that is a mean question – umm you mean nursing
the entire time
       So you could say the nursing and then say this particular role I suspect
   Soooooo umm - such a long time – umm - I graduated in ah - I started nursing in 1992. So I have been in neonates for over 20 years now
    And then you have been doing the umm – sort of community part of the job for how long
   Umm - If you are looking at how long I have been full time it is not quite 2 years – um – I was doing one day a week for 3 years I think before I became full time
 Yes - laughter
   Umm and then one other question we are supposed to ask is the ethnicity of our families that you have dealt with
   That I have worked with........
    yeh
  So the ones that I have done teleconferencing with – so the ones that I have done teleconferencing with have all been NZ European
   ok
And umm could you describe the range of patients and their conditions
   Um that I teleconferenced with
 Um - so a.....a couple were umm premature....umm – sorry I am trying to remember here.....
   Yeh yeh absolutely
   Um....they were a premature...I think one was extremely premature and the other one umm had issues with establishing feeding so...touch of
 1

  hypotonia I think and difficulty in establishing feeding
   Umm I suspect the majority of what you do see in the community from up here is the premature....is it
        Aaa...yes....premature....but there are also some complex medical issues.........a.....we do see ones who are tube feeding .... we do see them on oxygen but the majority would be ex prems and we also see...umm chromosomal anomalies
 yep
   Umm what um.....can you sort of describe your online consultations your treatment or whatever...I sort of just I mean...however you want to.........what your experience was before....what your experience was over covid and which methods you actually used
  So before covid we weren’t doing any teleconferencing so it was one of those things that we were talking about trying to get up and running but we hadn’t done any
   umm
   ......and then with covid umm of course we weren’t able to have that patient contact and so umm we established it as a way of keeping in touch with families...umm...so probably the majority of the contacts we had with families were still phone calls
 umm
ummm
Completely absolutely
and texts um but there were some families where it worked for us to do teleconferencing so um
Um I think you forget how much information you get from um body language
   And phone calls and texts are something that you have always used to complement your service anyway havent you
   Umm along with face to face......and I think the thing that the covid highlighted was that although the phone calls and texts are really good you do miss that face to face...and so that is where the teleconferencing was useful
      So was there a particular platform that you used......as in zoom...um that kind of stuff
  Yeh we used zoom....umm.....It was a bit a tricky to set up ‘cause I was doing it from home umm.....and I didnt have remote access. .....so I was having to use my own computer...um but try to establish it with a workplace um log in......umm and that was challenging
   So that sounds even more complicated...so for people using zoom for the first time they might have some issues with their own computer but you are saying that you were trying to do it through a third
   Yeh so I was trying to um.......so I had set up zoom for myself... for personal
 yeh
gosh
It sounds very complicated
But then I also had to set it up....um...for the CDHB contacts
Um.....and yeh...it was a bit complicated
laughter
          So I suspect that um I didnt always manage to maintain the pathways that I needed to but it hasn’t.........nothing has happened that has been an issue......but it yeh it was challenging
 And just to complete... the bit.....when you
  2

   were telephoning and texting which you have always used....and then youre complementing it now with zoom....from the covid point of view........did you find that you were increasing the amount of telephone and texts that you were using or or or not.....with
    Umm and do you think umm...what were the barriers to the families do you do you
mmm mmm
Very surprising isn’t it
And did you have experience of having done any telemed consultations before covid
So some of the barriers were technological.....
But a lot of it actually....it surprised me.....they were reluctant to have their face on a camera
And I didn’t think that would be an issue.....given the current day and age......
Umm I ...in a group situation so not running it myself
Umm with covid
   with not having to see............with not being able to see them did you find that there was a change I should say in how you texted or how you telephoned
   Umm – yes ......there were probably were more phone calls and texts...because of course there was a higher level of anxiety about everything.........um...and we had to change the way we were visiting so because we weren’t allowed in the homes we were delivering scales to the house...letting the families weigh their babies......and then taking the scales away and cleaning them.........umm and so there was .......we weren’t having that discussion outside the house for safety reasons umm and so then the families were contacting me afterwards with the weights..........and then we were discussing the weights and the feeding .....so it changed completely the way we were doing things..........umm and I found umm communicating only by phone and text was quite challenging for establishing routines of feeding at home you know what they were actually doing and how they were doing it...............and that’s where I had hoped that the teleconferencing would complement that but what I ended up finding was that there were actually not as many families as I had hoped that were willing to do the teleconferencing.......so it was trying to encourage families to use that forum as well....could um yeh....do the type of care that we were wanting to
    right
   Umm because they did not have umm computers, they just had phones, umm or they didn’t umm feel that they had enough access to umm wifi
      mmm
   And given that everyone is so familiar with social media and taking selfies and posting them and all that type of thing so I was quite surprised when people said that they did not want to put their face on camera
      Ahm – and so how comfortable were you.......you have talked about some of the technological....but how comfortable were you
   Once I worked out how it worked umm I actually found it umm quite easy to use
 3

   with the platform itself aside from the added complication of trying to do the...ummm via the work one
    Uhm ok
And they were at home
And ummm with the technology did you choose zoom or was.......
mmm
They were at home yeh
That was what was recommended to us by the hospital so that was the platform we went with
And that was actually really valuable and really worthwhile
   And were the patients when you spoke to them – I mean I have got assumptions here that I am trying not to make - where were they when you.......most of the time when you were talking to them where were they located
   Umm there were a couple of families that were in Christchurch itself and umm one of the families that I found it really useful for were actually umm rural so they were
      Umm did you have any telehealth or telemedical activities that involved other health professionals at the same time
   Ah yes it is how we maintained contact with the .....because I was unfortunately based at home during covid....umm that was one of the ways I maintained contact with the team at the hospital
    So from that am I understanding correctly that you would have some consultations with them without patients being there
  Correct.....umm yes.so we used Microsoft teams.....umm in some situations and then in others we used zoom but umm once the microsoft teams was established we used that to have our team meetings..umm and yes there were a couple of occasions where I met with....umm for example SLT by videoconferencing before we spoke with the mother
   So on those occasions you were then having a ......you say you did a professionals meeting that was a virtual meeting and then went on to do a multiprofessional type consult with the family
   Yes yes
     So sometimes I did it just with the family and other times I did it with umm the team......umm there was one case that was very tricky because they didn’t have... they didn’t have a computer at home and they didn’t have the ability to link in with me for a teleconference but they were having difficulties feeding their baby and they wanted that input with the babys feeding ............and so the only way I could come up with how we would do it...they actually videoed her feeding but it was then trying to find a platform that they understood to drop the video on to so that I could access it and the only way I could do that was to create a new facebook name and give them access to that..... they were the only ones that had access to it and they dropped the video on to that so that I could see it and umm
 That is a great idea
And then phone them and talk to them
   So you thought of that idea...gosh
   That was the only...........because I knew that they were familiar with facebook but of course I did not want to link them in with me given the social circumstances umm and so I went in and created a
 4

     So were there.......I mean you have told me a few of these.........but were there any other tips that you can think about or strategies that worked really well in using zoom or teams
   Umm I tried to umm send people times umm because of course when you do that it gives them a link straight into you.....often I found it easier just to send them a link right at that moment so that they could link into me ...umm so I found that making an appointment with them didn’t necessarily work.....was too far in advance
 right
And to do that did you phone them or text them or
mmm
new name and friended them on that and then they dropped the video on
So making an appointment almost on the day worked better for the families
Yep so....I texted them and said umm how about we do a face to face.........
          And we organized a time that would work dependent on if they wanted me to watch the baby feed or not and then I would send them a link so that they could just click on it and come on
   And were there any situations where you think.....and I think that you have about this a little bit as well.........where it really wasn’t effective to have those kind of virtual meetings
  Umm unfortunately I think some of our families in the lower socioecononomic end of things ...........dont have the umm equipment to make it work......umm..and some who have a bit of anxiety...its not a ......they don’t feel comfortable on it either...umm..it is really difficult I think to come up with a hard and fast rule because everyone is so different....but I think one of the umm issues was that because it wasn’t really an established mode of communication......umm...it wasnt something that people automatically thought of using
 mmm
And so I think in that first instance we were umm a trying to establish something that hadn’t been normal
   Very well said - yeh. I have got a question about your approach to Maori clients or clients that identified with other ethnicities but I think you said that the most of the ones in that particular stage were actually
  Yeh....... There weren’t many unfortunately that chose to link in by teleconference......I still think it’s a very valuable tool umm and I certainly think that for some of our clients that we have more difficulty reaching because of where they reside its definitely a forum umm and I would like to further establish it but I think that until it gets to the point where it becomes more common practice we are still going to be fighting against it a little bit
   Ummm and you have already talked about the interprofessional approach with SLTs and things..did you.......what was your thoughts about using a virtual telemedicine type approach in that....do you think it has made aspects of interprofessional care easier or did it make it more challenging
        Ummm for the one case that we used it for umm with regards to feeding issues it definitely made it easier because there was the mother, SLT and me all on the same meeting, all seeing the same thing and being
 5

      able to come up with a plan ...ummm there was probably more difficulty for mum and if it hadn’t been.....because it was covid she had an older child that was at home that was very capable with the phone and able to hold the phone........................
   That’s very interesting
  And we were able to say to her can you move it slightly to the left umm.... you know that......we could give her instructions that would help the visibility of the feeding.....if she hadn’t been there it would have..it would have been very difficult
   And did any families feed back to you.....only about the use......our use of that kind of technology
 Umm that particular family umm found it really useful because she was feeling quite isolated....given the feeding difficulties ......umm another family that I used it with umm....I think they found it useful because it allowed us to put faces to the names and I think once she had established and knew who she was talking to she was fine talking by phone .........so umm....I think we....there wasnt a lot of feedback but umm other than from that one family but I think the ones that used it found it useful
   mmm and any other sort of umm positives about it that you haven’t already articulated or enablers of any other barriers around it
   Umm no I think the biggest issue was because we hadnt already set it up
 Pause as recorder saying no sound detected
mmm
Umm I wasn’t either
And have you had any training in telemedicine equipment and how to do consultations...
absolutely
Is that right..that is what Alistair would say is always go for google - yeh
laugh
No
Laughter
but – I was quite a fast learner.....google was quite useful
youtube
   What were we saying.....barriers and enablers
   I think because it hadnt already been set up equipment was the biggest barrier..........umm and remote access would have been really useful for me
    And then are you are aware of any guidelines around telemedicine and how to use that kind of stuff
   No
    Umm and did you have a structure for your sessions.....so you have talked about how you felt the appointment didn’t work and it was easier to sort of text and say....did you have an actual structure for your consult that you did.....or a specific template..or did you vary
   No I tried to run it the way that I do home visits........so umm pretty much I went in saying you know hi this is who I am umm.......and this is what we do and then went into the how are you and how is the feeding and that type of things....so I structured it the same way I usually do a home visit
          Umm and so these are just a couple of last questions based on your experience what key learning needs would you say you have identified for the use of virtual type consultations in your practice
   Umm I think that it would be really beneficial for an education session around how to use zoom and microsoft teams umm... because of course we all went into it having to teach ourselves really.... umm......and it is much easier having someone teaching you......you dont pick everything up when you are doing it by
 6

      yourself.........I am sure I didn’t do it 100% correctly but I was just excited to get someone on the other end
 laughter I felt that was quite successful
That is very good isn’t it Umm yeh sessions
   Has that sort of experience changed your practice..or is there a way you think it might influence future practice
   Umm Its changed my practice in that if I have a family out of town umm instead of saying we cannot support you you are not within our area I would feel happy to offer teleconference
    That was my last formal question..is there anything else that you would like to add or ask about your experience really
  No I don’t think.....umm I thought it was really good umm I guess being forced into having to get it up and running because it was something that we had been talking about..so the fact that covid happened meant that we were forced into it..umm and because i was based at home I really had to do it ... umm...but I am sure that there are better ways of introducing the concept to our families than the way we did it
      So I think if we were going to umm carry it on as a regular form of communication I think that we should be developing something to be able to give to families to say this is what we can do given that you are living out of the area
 Great that sounds fabulous
